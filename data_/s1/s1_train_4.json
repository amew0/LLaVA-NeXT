Pedestrian involvement: No pedestrian involvement is mentioned.. Road type: The specific road type is not provided, but this type of incident could occur in any urban setting, typically on residential or commercial streets.. Weather conditions: No specific weather conditions are mentioned.. Congestion: The collision might cause some temporary congestion if it obstructs a lane, particularly in areas with higher traffic density..
